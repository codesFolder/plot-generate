## How to Run

Since Insight is a client-side application, it can be hosted on any static file server.

### Local Development
1.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd insight---no-code-data-analysis
    ```
2.  Serve the files using any static server. Examples:
    *   **Node.js**: `npx serve .`
    *   **Python**: `python -m http.server 3000`
    *   **VS Code**: Right-click `index.html` -> "Open with Live Server".

3.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown clearly in your terminal).

## Project Structure

*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point. Contains the layout, modal structures, and import tags.
*   **`js/`**:
    *   **`main.js`**: Application entry logic, file handling (Excel/CSV), and event listeners.
    *   **`ui.js`**: Dashboard rendering engine, chart logic, and statistics calculations.
    *   **`report.js`**: Logic for capturing state and generating the downloadable HTML report.
    *   **`state.js`**: Simple global state management (`STATE.data`, `STATE.columns`).
    *   **`api.js`**: (Legacy/Optional) Stub for future backend API extensions.
*   **`css/`**:
    *   (Mostly deprecated in favor of Tailwind, but contains customization overrides).
